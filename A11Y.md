<h1>Accessibility Improvement Approach<h1>
In our application, we have committed to adhering to standard accessibility practices, ensuring that our platform is inclusive and usable for all users, including those with disabilities. Following the accessibility lessons covered in our lectures, we have implemented several key features to enhance accessibility:

1. **Alternative Text for Images**
Descriptive Alt Text: Every image in our application is accompanied by descriptive alternative text. This practice ensures that users who rely on screen readers can understand the content and function of each image, enhancing the experience for visually impaired users.

2. **ARIA Labels for Icon Buttons**
Accessible Icon Buttons: For buttons that use icons without accompanying text, we have added ARIA labels. These labels provide screen reader users with the necessary context, making our user interface more accessible and navigable.

3. **Color Contrast**
High Contrast Colors: We have carefully chosen colors with sufficient contrast to ensure that text and interactive elements are easily distinguishable. This not only benefits users with visual impairments but also enhances overall readability and user experience.

4. **Readability**
Clear and Legible Text: The text across our application is designed for easy readability. We have selected fonts, sizes, and colors that are easy to read for users with varying degrees of visual acuity.

5. **Keyboard Navigation**
Full Keyboard Accessibility: Our application can be fully navigated using a keyboard. This feature is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse, ensuring they can access all functionalities of the app.

6. **Semantic HTML**
Use of Semantic HTML Tags: We have employed semantic HTML tags throughout our application. This practice helps in creating a logical structure and aids screen readers in interpreting the page content correctly.
